        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi!  I'm Tracy and this is my spot. I'm beginning to get
            used to sharing my stuff that I have been working on! My many talents include breaking things... and fixing them! I break, I fix, I break, I fix. The cycle continues.
            And best of all, I keep learning.</p>
        <p>Mine is not a typical "I grew up with computers" or "I've been hacking since I was 8 years old" story.</p>
        <p>My development story begins in 2016. That was when I decided to transition from flying up in the "friendly" clouds after 20+ years, to delving into
            the other type of clouds! Tenacity and resourcefulness have always been qualities of mine, and I finally get to put to use as I
            learn more about developing applications.  Even after hours staring at my computer wondering why "it doesn't work," I have begun to spread
            my (not so metallic uniform) wings and solve problems. One of the great things about learning to make software is that my environment
            isn't limited to a "tin can" 33K feet in the air!</p>
