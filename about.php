    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hi!  I'm Tracy and this is my spot. I'm beginning to get
        used to sharing my stuff that I have been working on! My many talents include breaking things... and fixing them! I break, I fix, I break, I fix. The cycle continues.
        And best of all, I keep learning.</p>
    <p>Mine is not a typical "I grew up with computers" or "I've been hacking since I was 8 years old" story.</p>
    <p>My development story begins in 2016. That was when I decided to transition from flying up in the "friendly" clouds after 20+ years, to delving into
        the other type of clouds! Tenacity and resourcefulness have always been qualities of mine, and I finally get to put to use as I
        learn more about developing applications.  Even after hours staring at my computer wondering why "it doesn't work," I have begun to spread
        my (not so metallic uniform) wings and solve problems. One of the great things about learning to make software is that my environment
        isn't limited to a "tin can" 33K feet in the air!</p>
<p>
    Having been "around the block," I think that my perspective is unique and useful in a few ways. Most recently, when talking about tech to my 75 year old mother!
    I help her navigate websites remotely, on the phone! I am looking forward to my golden years since it seems like we will be living forever! The cool thing though,
    is that these older desktop and mostly handheld users remember TI-35 calculators and that was the newest tech!
    Telstar (before nintendo) was the latest thing and the Paperboy still dropped off their evening news. And these folks are PURCHASING AND LEARNING the conveniences
    and instantaneousness that we take for granted. I think that they need to be remembered when GUI is created.... and I know for a fact, they aren't. Pity,
    because they can create much response and revenue. If you stumble upon this page, please remember these folks, they'll love the
    facility of your creations!
